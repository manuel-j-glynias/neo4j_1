Upon intravenous administration, the peptide moiety of letolizumab specifically targets and binds to CD40L expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents the binding of CD40L to its cognate receptor CD40 expressed on B-lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). This prevents T-cell mediated proliferation and differentiation of B-cells, and prevents the production of antibodies. By inhibiting both the production of anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibodies by B-cells and GPIIb/IIIa-dependent T-cell proliferation, letolizumab may prevent platelet destruction and may increase platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The direct binding of letolizumab to CD40L on platelets further prevents CD40L/CD40-mediated destruction by macrophages and DCs in ITP.

This stimulates the maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs). Activation of DCs results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune responses against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which lead to tumor cell lysis. TLR7 and 8, members of the TLR family, play fundamental roles in the activation of the innate immune system, myeloid cell responses and tumor antigen presentation. Pegylation of the TLR7/8 agonist enhances retention of this agent in the tumor microenvironment (TME), provides local sustained release of the TLR7/8 agonist, increases efficacy and reduces systemic exposure compared to the administration of the naked TLR7/8 agonist alone.",

This inhibits A2BR activity and prevents adenosine/A2BR-mediated signaling. The inhibition of A2BR in cancer cells prevents activation of downstream oncogenic pathways, which leads to an inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis. A2BR inhibition also prevents the release of various growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) from immune cells, which may abrogate the adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and activate the immune system to exert anti-tumor immune responses against cancer cells leading to tumor cell killing. In addition, under non-cancerous inflammatory conditions, inhibition of A2BR leads to reduced activation and proliferation of various immune cells, which results in decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and may prevent inflammation.

Upon intratumoral administration of double-armed TMZ-CD40L/4-1BBL oncolytic Ad5/35 adenovirus LOAd703, the virus infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells. This causes direct oncolysis and the release of a plethora of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells. The released TAAs stimulate the immune system and activate anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby further killing tumor cells. In addition, infected tumor cells and tumor stroma cells, including stellate cells and infiltrating immune cells, express the immunostimulants CD40L and 4-1BBL. The expressed CD40L and 4-1BBL proteins activate the CD40L- and 4-1BBL-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. This activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages.

TYRO3, AXL and MER, members of the TAM family of RTKs, are overexpressed in many tumor cell types. TAMs play key roles in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, and their expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. c-Met, also overexpressed in many tumor cell types, plays a critical role in tumor formation, proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and contributes to tumor resistance. In the TME, TAM expression on immune cells contributes to tumor cell evasion of immune surveillance and to the negative regulation of immune responses.","Antagonist"

Upon administration of HSP90-targeted SN-38 conjugate PEN-866, the HSP90 ligand moiety targets HSP90, which allows the conjugate to penetrate, accumulate and be retained in the tumor cell. Once the linker is cleaved, the SN-38 moiety is released in a sustained manner. SN-38 then binds to and inhibits topoisomerase I by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, which results in DNA breaks, inhibition of DNA replication and apoptosis. Compared to SN-38 alone, PEN-866 preferentially targets, accumulates  and is retained in the tumor cells due to its binding to Hsp90, which results in increased concentrations of SN-38 at the tumor site. This allows sustained release of SN-38 and leads to increased and prolonged efficacy while reducing toxicity to normal, healthy tissues. Hsp90, a chaperone protein upregulated and activated in a variety of tumor cells compared to normal healthy tissue, regulates the folding, stability and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins.",

Upon administration of the anti-BCMA sparX protein plus BCMA-directed ARC T-cells CART-ddBCMA, the sparX protein, with its two BCMA binding domains, specifically targets and binds to two BCMA expressed on tumor cells.

Upon administration of anti-PD-1/CD47 infusion protein HX009, the agent simultaneously and selectively targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on T-lymphocytes and CD47 on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by HX009 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1 blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore effector T-cell functions and may further activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell killing. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-1, HX009 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis.

MSCs are pluripotent, and are capable of being recruited to damaged tissue sites and differentiating along specific lineages when stimulated. Infusion of MSCs results in: a) increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10, prostaglandin E, and hepatocyte growth factor; b) decreased mononuclear phagocyte expression of indoleamine 2,3,-dioxygenase, which catabolizes L-tryptophan into its metabolites, which in turn contribute to inflammation; and c) modulated dendritic cell maturation and disrupted activities of natural killer cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.",

The furin bifunctional shRNA blocks furin protein production. Decreased levels of furin lead to a reduction in the conversion of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta into TGF beta1 and beta2 protein isoforms. In turn, as part of the negative feedback mechanism, reduced furin protein levels inhibit TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 gene expression, thereby further decreasing TGF levels. As TGFs are potent immunosuppressive cytokines, reducing their levels may activate the immune system locally and this may eventually cause a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells.",
